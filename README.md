# Real-Estate-Price-predictor
This project builds a real estate price prediction website.
First I have built a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
Second I Have written a code for python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 
During this entire project I have used various things such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. 
Technology and tools I have used covers,

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
Python flask for http server
HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
